Exercise 20
In 3 previous exercises, we built up a few components needed to build a Tic Tac Toe game in Dart:
Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board
Checking whether a game board has a winner
Handle a player move from user input
The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game!
Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend.
There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:
You should keep track of who won - if there is a winner, show a congratulatory message on the screen.
If there are no more moves left, don’t ask for the next player’s move!
:notes: Keep in mind, the current solution is not just a copy pase of functions from the previous exercises, but rather a rework of them.
